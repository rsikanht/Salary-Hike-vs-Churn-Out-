# R^2 value is 0.83 which is a best fit model.
#We can write eq. as SH=244.36+(-0.10)*SH

# From the provided data set, the correlation value is -0.91 where both variables are strong and negatively correlated.
# Co-ef. are significant and co-ef.of Determination value. i.e R^2 is 0.96 which is good.
# sum of errors is -7.844392e-12 i.e approx 0 and errors are equally distributed.
# Hence model is best fit and salary hike is an appropriate input to determine churn out rate.
